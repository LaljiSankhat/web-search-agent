The Python Coding Practice Problems page offers exercises on loops, functions, lists, strings, dictionaries, sets and advanced structures like heaps and deques.This Python tutorial is updated based on latest Python 3.13.1 version.", 'Machine learning is a branch of\xa0Artificial Intelligence\xa0that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:This section covers preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and model evaluation to prepare data, uncover insights and build reliable models.Supervised learning\xa0algorithms are generally categorized into\xa0two main types:There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:This is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Used when the output is a "yes or no" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.A model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use.A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data.This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity.A quick and smart way to classify things based on probability. It works well for text and spam detection.A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability.Ensemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:Unsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose:Clustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Methods:Distribution-based Methods:Connectivity based methods:Density Based methods:Dimensionality reduction is used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information.Find patterns between items in large datasets typically in market basket analysis.Reinforcement learning interacts with environment and learn from them based on rewards.These methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results.The agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback.It uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data making it helpful when labeling data is costly or it is very limited.Forecasting models analyze past data to predict future trends, commonly used for time series problems like sales, demand or stock prices.The trained ML model must be integrated into an application or service to make its predictions accessible.APIs allow other applications or systems to access the ML model\'s functionality and integrate them into larger workflows.MLOps ensure they are deployed, monitored and maintained efficiently in real-world production systems.']
